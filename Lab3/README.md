**Portfolio Website**
This project is a basic Portfolio Website created as part of my Web Development assignment.
The main goal of this project is to apply the concepts of HTML structure, CSS styling, Flexbox, Grid, and Media Queries to build a clean and responsive one-page website.
The portfolio includes different sections like Hero, About, Skills, Projects, and Contact, helping me practice layout designing, responsiveness, and user-friendly page organization.

**Features**
1.Clean and simple layout
2.Hero / About / Skills / Projects / Contact sections
3.Hover effects and basic animations
4.Fully responsive design
5.Smooth scrolling and user-friendly structure

**Technologies Used**

CSS3 (Flexbox + Grid + Media Queries)
